    <d1>Hello, and welcome to Rune Search! I am Goat.</d1>
    <d2>I love to eat letters! Use the arrow keys to help me find them. (I can't see very well...)</d2>
    <d3>If YOU need to go eat something, press 'p' to pause the game.</d3>
    <d4>Oh and also, watch out for any weirdos lurking around in the letters. You never really know what is out there...</d4>
    <d5>Y'all ready?</d5>

  	<d1>The door saw you didn't have a key and stomped off in a huff...</d1>

  <music>
    <d1>Check out some traditional Goat music!</d1>
    <d2>Passed down the Goat family for generations, of course.</d2>
